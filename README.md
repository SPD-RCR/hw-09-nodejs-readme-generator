# hw-09-nodejs-readme-generator

## Finished but...

- Need to record walk through and rewrite this README

```
index.js asks the questions
Then inserts the answers into a newly created file = "GENERATED-README.md"
This is done to avoid writing over this Repo README.md

generateMarkDown.js creates the license button and related link based on which license is selected
```
