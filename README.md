# hw-09-nodejs-readme-generator

## Work-in-Progress

```
index.js asks the questions
Then inserts the answers into a newly created file = "GENERATED-README.md"
This is done to avoid writing over this Repo README.md
```

- Updated questions
- Added Badge icon
- Started to write MarkDown to generate Badge with link for user selected Badge.

### More to come this afternoon.
